# Python Quiz - Beginner Level

## What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language used. It's often used by beginners because it has a human readable syntax structure.

## Why should you learn it?
It's a solid choice for a first programming language. Its versatility makes it useful for a lot of different technologies, and even though its not the best at one specific thing, python brings you a wide range of practical capablities. Program scripts, or bots, or automations, or server side software, or games. The only place it could be considered lacking is in the frontend web universe.

## How does this guide/workshop work?
We at EHC have innovated to provide a workshop experience from the workshops we've been to and what we've seen.
1. Live Run-through.
- A major issue for new programmers and even us when we are learning new things is a lack of content. The analogy I like to use is the ikea furniture model. You are building a piece of ikea furniture. You have the instructions. Now what? You follow the instructions and build the furniture. But let's say you have never seen the type of furniture you are building, or how to build a piece of furniture, or how to follow a set of instructions. You will have no clue how to build the furniture. Now replace furniture with code. Our goal with these live run-throughs is to provide that context by doing the workshops by following the instructions in ten minutes or less. 
2. Question Time.
- We want people to ask questions, but we want to keep it under wraps in a large room with 30+ people. We go from a ten minute live run-through where people have high attention spans, to a set of time for pure questions.
3. Instruction Set/Work Time
- Programming is intuitively a solo sport. Even in a collaborative aspect, writing code is still done one person at a line at a time. Instruction sets, like this one, will guide people to building a project and then options for creating customizations.
4. Demo Time
- Demoing your project is great way to feel good about what you have made and to continue to make progress. It’s an amazing feeling to stand up and look back at the work you have done, even if it was only in 20-30 minutes.

## THE START TO THE WORKSHOP
Building a custom python quiz.

### Part 1
**Creating your quiz function**
*There are many ways to solve a problem.*
We will be taking a unique and slightly complex approach to solving the problem of making a python quiz game. We will be programming using functions…
